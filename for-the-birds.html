            <p>What is the first bird that comes to your mind? The pigeons that congregate on the sidewalk outside your apartment? Maybe a bald eagle? If you’re a baseball fan, maybe a cardinal or blue jay?</p>
            <p>I’m willing to bet you don’t think of the common yellowthroat, eastern meadowlark, belted kingfisher, scarlet tanager, or rose-breasted grosbeak.</p>
            <p>There are over 2,000+ bird species found in North America. Around 300 bird species can be found in Chicago, where I live, either seasonally or year-round. Over 200 live in or visit New York City each year. Some are just stopping through on their annual migration. Others stay relatively close to home year-round. They all help pollinate plants, distribute seeds, and manage pests. The more birds you see and hear, the more likely you are to be in a healthy ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Watching and listening for birds is a great way to engage with nature and the world around you. Next time you walk around town, stop to look and listen. You might just see or hear a bird you didn’t know you share a neighborhood with.</p>
